Anna Viktoria Castellano (*19.03.1993 in Milano) is an Italian-German actress.

From a very young age, Viktoria had a strong passion for art. Acting, painting, writing, and music have always been a part of her everyday life. She attended the European school in Italy and consequently speaks five languages. She has always been fond of sports, such as horse riding, skiing, surfing, and ballet.

As a teenager, she moved to Austria and began an apprenticeship as a hotel and catering assistant, which she completed in 2013. After that, she attended evening school from 2016 to 2020 and passed her A-levels there.

In the meantime, aged 22, she resumed work at the theater. As a result, she acted on stage for the “Haller Burgsommer” for two years under the direction of Elmar Drexel and in 2017 she joined the team of “Bogentheater” located in Innsbruck.

One year later, she got her first leading part in a one-act play, and in 2019, she starred as Queen Mary Stuart in a modern adaption of the drama for “Projekttheater Hall” in Tyrol.

Since then, she has worked on many projects on stage, on camera, and for the Tyrolean State Theatre.

Whilst working, she studied from 2020 to 2023, to get her acting degree at the Paritätische Kommission in Vienna. She has passed successfully.

Viktoria now moved back to Italy and is currently working under the tutelage of Ms. Lia Locatelli.
